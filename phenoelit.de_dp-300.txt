[ Overview ]
        The D-Link Ethernet/Fast Ethernet Print Server DP-300+
        provides network connectivity for printers.
	
[ Description ]
        By sending an oversized POST request to an existing web page such 
	as /Config1.htm, the device web server dies.  A process appears to be 
	listening on the port but will no longer answer requests.  Additionally, 
	the print server reports an uptime of less then one minute after the 
	attack, indicating that the software dies during this time.

[ Example ]
        See above

[ Solution ]
	None known at this time.
