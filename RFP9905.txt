----[ 1. Scope of problem 

        Zeus is a high-performance webserver available from Zeus 
Technologies (www.zeus.co.uk). There's a myriad of problems, that when 
combined together, could yield a remote root compromise. Let's review the 
progression: 

-[ Bad search engine CGI 

        This is really the core of the problem. Zeus has the option to 
setup a search engine for your virtual website(s). This feature is 
accessible via www.zeus.server/search (not /search/, big difference). If 
the engine is available (it's an optional feature), it can be used to 
request any file that's accessible by the web server uid (which is *asked 
for* on install...unwise administrators may pick 'root', which is a bad 
choice. We shall assume they pick the typical 'nobody'). The mechanism 
is in the search form: 

        <form action="/search" method=POST> 
        <input type=hidden name=indexfile 
        value="/usr/local/zeus/html/search.index"> 
        <input type=hidden name=template 
        value="/usr/local/zeus/web/etc/search_output.html"> 
        Query: <input type=text name=expr value=""> 
        <input type=submit value=Search> 

Notice the values for indexfile and template. Hard server paths is 
usually a good give-away. ;) 

Now if we recreate our own form, we can change the values of indexfile and 
template to suit our liking. Modifying indexfile will get us know where, 
as it will be virtually impossible to find a file (worth reading) that 
Zeus will read as a search index (since it's not in the proper internal 
format). However, the template is more interesting. This is the file 
that is opened and given to us, simply by replacing a few variables to 
insert the search output. Well, who needs search output. If we change 
template to be /etc/passed, you'll get /etc/passwd as your search result. 
Simple enough. Let's dig deeper... 

-[ Administrative interface password 

        Zeus comes with a web UI for administration. This server is 
typically plopped on port 9090, and is installed as *ROOT*. This is 
important, since it needs to change the configuration files around. There 
is no option to not run it as root. Well, technically, you can, but it 
won't startup, due to insufficient permissions to open and modify various 
configuration files. I suppose you can really tweak it to run as a 
non-root uid, but it's a load of thought to convert everything over by 
hand. 

Anyways, so the UI runs as root...it would be nice to be able to play 
around with root permissions, eh? The only thing stopping us is a http 
authentication login. And since we can read any file on the server, how 
about reading the file with the administrative password? The 
configuration file for the administrative website is (by default) 
/usr/local/zeus/admin/website. In this file you'll see a line similiar 
to: 

        modules!access!users!admin yoEPUmukiYLrPvz4jqBeJQ== 

This is the username/password combo. The default is 'admin' for a 
user...but unfortunately the password is queried on install. The format 
is pretty simple -- base 64 uuencoded MD5 hash. Let's verify. 

My password is 'admrox'. First I make a small file with the following 
contents: 

        begin-base64 644 test.out 
        yoEPUmukiYLrPvz4jqBeJQ== 
        ==== 

Notice it's just the password from the Zeus configuration file. I now run 
this through uudecode and hexdump: 

        [[root@wicca /tmp]# cat password.txt | uudecode -o - | hexdump 
        0000000 81ca 520f a46b 8289 3eeb f8fc a08e 255e 

Now, I can compare with the known MD5 hash of my password: 

        [[root@wicca /tmp]# md5sum --string="admrox" 
        ca810f526ba48982eb3efcf88ea05e25 "admrox" 

Looking at them side by side: 

        81ca 520f a46b 8289 3eeb f8fc a08e 255e 
        ca81 0f52 6ba4 8982 eb3e fcf8 8ea0 5e25 

A little byte inversion, and we have a match. Based on this you can 
modify your brute force password cracker of choice to run through the 
available choices (I prefer John the Ripper for this particular operation. 
Available from www.openwall.com/john/). I will leave brute force cracking 
the password up to you. But it is feasible to find the password. Now 
that we have it... 

-[ Using the web administration UI 

        This is just more of an afterthought. It's possible to do many 
nasty things, including making a virtual website who's document root is /, 
enabling file uploads (via http PUT method), etc. If you enable file 
uploads, you can upload binaries or Zeus scripts into the web 
administration UI directory (default is /usr/local/zeus/admin/docroot) and 
then call them through the UI--which will then be ran as root. I leave 
the possible forms of attack to your imagination. 

----[ 2. Solution 

        Well, it's two-fold: for now, you should immediately disable the 
search engine on any virtual sites you may have. This will stop the 
attack. It is also wise to restrict access to the web administration UI 
to a select few hosts. The ability to do this is provided in the web UI. 

I would like to mention that Zeus really is an amazing little server...and 
the UI is really nicely done. It supports a lot of stuff, and has some 
interesting functionality. I recommend giving it a whirl. Runs on the 
majority of Unix platforms. Unfortunately the price is a bit steep 
($1699). Luckily they have a 30-day eval. ;) 

----[ 3. Miscellaneous Updates 

        A few notes while I have the chance to say them: 

Whisker 1.1.1 has been released. It fixes a lot of various bugs on both 
unix and windows platforms. I suggest you download the latest version 
from www.wiretrip.net/rfp/. It's important that windows users read the 
included install.txt file. 

I've also received some wonderful feedback and scan scripts. I will be 
compiling and releasing them next weekend, with the last Octoberfest 
release. Actually, next weekend will definatley be the grand finale. ;) 
I'm shooting for the launch of my website, new scan scripts, another 
'release', and maybe some extra whitepapers and whatnot scattered into the 
mix. All in time for the Samhain New Year. :) 

Many thanks to wabe for giving me the idea to check out Zeus. :)
