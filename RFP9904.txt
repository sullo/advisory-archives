October is Octoberfest Advisory month: one rfp.labs release planned each

for the whole month of October!  (Now, let's see if I can pull it off....)

----[ 1. Revoke/Update of RFP9903

        Ok, I released RFP9903 detailing a little bug about insecure
AeDebug registry permissions yesterday.  Unfortunately, I did not do
thorough homework, as Mnemonix (who is always two steps ahead of me in my
though processes :) had reported this vulnerability as early as July 1998
(!) to NTBugtraq.  Apologies and credits then to Mnemonix.  RFP9903 was
cancelled for distribution, but it may have leaked out in a few channels.
So, to save face, I am releasing another advisory in it's place, in
efforts to maintain the Octoberfest advisory festival!  Anyways, onto the
info (don't want to be as long as my RDS advisory. ;)


----[ 2. Problem

        TeamTrack server, published by TeamShare, is available from
www.teamtrack.com.  It's purpose, to quote the web search engine spam
located at the bottom of their website:

teamshare teamtrack web based defect bug tracking track teamshare
teamtrack web based defect bug tracking track teamshare teamtrack
web based defect bug tracking track

        The problem is with the included web server they use to access the
database--it allows unrestricted retrieval of any file on the filesystem.
Observe this session:

        In case you haven't figured it out already, it runs on NT, and as
a service.  This means it has system access to any file.

----[ 3. Solution

        TeamTrack also includes the option to use Netscape
FastTrack/Enterprise or IIS instead.  I suggest you look into this.  The
SP4 readme includes information/instructions on how to migrate to one of
these webservers.


----[ 4. Miscellaneous Updates (From RFP9903)

        - Like I mentioned before, October is Octoberfest Advisory month.
I'm going to attempt to release something every week.  Hopefully you'll
find the stuff worthwhile...I think there's some planned goodies.  A
little NT, a little unix, a little web, all good. :)

        - My website is narrowing completion!  Many people have been
wondering if I have archives of my releases, programs, research, etc.  The
answer is 'yes', and soon it will be made public.  More information on
this in the next release (next week :)

        - Many people have emailed me wondering about the release of
version two of the RDS script.  This is one of the planned releases. 
Gimme time to finish coding it. 

        - Why the formal advisory numbering system and format?  Well, it's
really to better organize my own personal filing, really.  And you'll see
how it fits into my website design in a little bit.  In case you're
wondering, RFP9901 was the ODBC article posted May 25th, and RFP9902 was
the RDS posted June 23rd? (or July 23rd).

        - Phrack 55 is out--good stuff.  www.phrack.com Packetstorm is
back.  packetstorm.securify.com.  Technotronic still rules. 
www.technotronic.com. 

        - Practical application of one of the perl problems I talked about
in Phrack 55 landed JFS $1,000 for hacking securelinux.hackpcweek.com. 
Congrats, JFS.
